What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A ".git" file is added (it's hidden). This file keeps track (the status) of all files 
in the repository. You need to create a repository, it will keep track of all the files
within it and also its subfolders (and therefore, the files in these subfolders).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is actually the place where you have your files. It just have the 
last version of each one. The staging area is "the place" where you add the files (from the
working directory) that you want to commit to the repository. The repository holds all the changes
of each file since the creation of each one. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
